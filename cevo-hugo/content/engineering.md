  "The only competitive advantage today is adaptability. To deliver valuable new concepts and solutions faster than the competition, organisations need the ability to rapidly deploy code to production, and then iterate based on customer feedback".

We build solutions that enable businesses to [realise their goals](/cases/engineering) by offering our diverse range of services weather it is writing applications ‘ground up’ , improving existing technology implementations, improving delivery practices by being hands on technologist rather than hand waving consultants. We build measurable quality outcomes in our delivery methodology. Our engineering approach is hybrid of the technologies we use, the delivery model we support and the engineering practices we champion. We do not believe on delivering only what was signed on the dotted lines but collaborate with our customers to solve an existing challenge or build new capabilities. Our engineering consultants are not tied up to any particular coding language, architectural approach, project management techniques because we truly believe that each assignment should be handled on its own merits and uniques challenges.We understand that work done today is legacy tomorrow hence we always like to build solutions with your team rather than for your team. We thrive in identifying and implementing new business offerings while acknowledging the constraints and make sound trade off in the interest of our customers.

We build software with our clients rather than for our clients. We write applications, build API’s, improve performance (insert other ‘things we build’ here?) and share these skills and knowledge with the customers we are working with. We can write Ruby, Python, .NET, Clojure, Scala, Lambdas (insert relevant other things we do here?)

We deliver technology outcomes that solve problems, that are resilient, scalable and supportable. We do this in collaboration with our clients so the engineering skills and experience we bring to your organisation stays within your team long after the project is delivered or the initiative completed.

A high performing technology, engineering or software delivery team need to be able to:

* Form a business case
* Effectively analyse a problem, understand constraints and form a plan to get it done
* Design, develop, test and implement a solution
* Seek feedback and validate the solution met the needs of the business case

An empowered, poly-skilled, cross-functional team can do all of these tasks in small chunks and short iterations using working software as the primary measure of progress. This is what it is to be agile rather than do agile.
