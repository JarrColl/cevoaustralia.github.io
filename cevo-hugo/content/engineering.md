The Cevo team are a group of technologists and engineers. We are software developers, business analysts, product owners, testers, infrastructure, automation and devops specialists and cloud advocates. Our team are cross functional and poly-skilled, meaning each Cevo technologist has an intermediate to expert level of skill in at least two of the above disciplines.

We write applications, build API’s, improve team and system performance and migrate workloads to the cloud. We do this in collaboration with our clients so the engineering skills and experience we bring to your organisation stays within your team long after the engagement is completed. We empower our clients rather than build dependence. It’s our duty of care to our customers, and ensures you don’t get handed back a technology solution that is difficult to support.

Some examples of our engineering work to date are: Mapping systems couplings for and dependencies for discovery and profit
