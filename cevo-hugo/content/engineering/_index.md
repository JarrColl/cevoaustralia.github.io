  The only competitive advantage today is adaptability. To deliver valuable new concepts and solutions faster than the competition, organisations need the ability to rapidly deploy code to production, and then iterate based on customer feedback.

# TECHNOLOGY IS THE BUSINESS

Technology evolution has rapidly changed how organisations design, develop and deliver products and services. Digital companies that release software quickly, identify more new market opportunities with less up-front investment. Most importantly, they adapt faster and are better equipped to make more informed decisions on work prioritisation, people and resource allocation.

# WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?

In large, complex organisations regularly releasing high quality software that customersâ€™ love can be a challenge. Particularly if IT is still on a journey from being a non-critical, back- office function to a service-oriented and strategic business enabler. Cumbersome organisational workflow, redundant business processes and overzealous governance burden software delivery teams, unnecessarily increasing software delivery cycle time, for no benefit to the end user. Annual planning and budgeting can also drive shortsighted and inefficient purchasing decisions. The mindset they create can restrict an organisations ability to respond to shifting market conditions and capitalise quickly on new, unforeseen market opportunities.

# WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?

* Speed to market. Iterative software development delivers products and services into the hands of customers faster
* Save time and money. Reduce the risk of delayed and over budget software projects by delivering iteratively.
* Do more with less. Save time and effort on low priority development by building the most important components first and using customer validation to identify the point of diminishing return
* Improve quality. Reduce software defects and time spent on bug fixing through test automation
