I recently gave a talk at a client titled _DevOps: State Of The Union_. In this talk, I detailed my professional journey driving the DevOps transformation at REA Group.

The specific items I talked about was:
* **REA's orgnisational structure and culture at 2009,2011,2013 and 2015**
* **Contrasting an IT support operating model at REA to places like Google or Facebook**
* **My perspective on DevOps**
* **Empathy, and why language like 'us' and 'we' is important**
