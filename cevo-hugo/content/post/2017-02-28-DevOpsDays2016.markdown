We all know DevOps is not about the tools or the process, it’s about a deeper cultural movement. But all too often we think about what DevOps is, and miss the focus on Why we do it in the first place.

In this presentation we explore:

* The organisational context that is most likely to support a successful DevOps initiative
* What questions you should be asking and how to frame the conversation when engaging with organisational leaders and non technical colleagues
* How to connect the key values a DevOps initiative can generate with real business problems
* Why we do all this
