# COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION

Born of the need to improve IT service delivery agility, the devops movement emphasises communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT operations. Rather than seeing these two groups as silos who pass things along, but don’t really work together, devops recognises the interdependence of software development and IT operations and helps an organisation produce software and IT services rapidly, with frequent iterations.


# WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?

Continuous delivery is an important practice in the devops philosophy, and aims at delivering high quality software in an efficient, fast and reliable manner. Today, in many organisations, the delivery of software is manual, time consuming, stressful and costly. Often, as soon as the application goes live, issues pop up, forcing the organisation into another costly release cycle. Transforming the release process into an automated, reliable, high quality continuous deployment pipeline that is essential to competing in today’s marketplace.
