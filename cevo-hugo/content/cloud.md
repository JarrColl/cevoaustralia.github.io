# The Cloud

Moving to the cloud is a great way to technology driven organisations to achieve scale and resilience. Engineering for the cloud requires the ability to write code for constrained infrastructure. This raises the bar for your delivery teams and requires architectural approaches and software delivery practices that achieve resilience by baking quality into the development lifecycle.

Good software delivery practices

It is no secret that Cloud is here to stay. Be it your favourites coffee shop, academic institutions, insurance provider, medical services  or financial institution - scaling business, acquiring new customers and ensuring uptime is a key to a successful business.Engaging customers via compelling digital touch points such as web, mobile, kiosk, intelligent bots are increasingly crucial to keep a healthy and happy customer base for any business. 


[Cevo recognises](/cases/cloud) this and has been at the forefront of delivering cloud solutions for our customers. Cevo offers variety of services such cloud migration, cloud first or hybrid approach of on-premise and cloud infrastructure. We at Cevo understand that cloud by itself will not solve many challenges thus we also help and consult our customers to build their softwares which are “cloud friendly” right from the beginning. We believe that infrastructure automation and software architectures are the underpinning of a solid cloud strategy and bring those skills as a part of our Cloud Service offering.

We do not believe in the build and transfer approach to our delivery. We closely work with customer teams across software development, project planning and operations to ensure that we build a solutions that suits the needs of the business as well as cross skill client team members for the future.
