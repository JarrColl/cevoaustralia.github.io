# AUTOMATE YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE

One of the ultimate objectives of the devops discipline is to make infrastructure fully programmable and automated, infrastructure-as-code. Infrastructure automation is the process of describing your infrastructure and its configuration as a script or set of scripts so that environments can be replicated with minimal human interference. Infrastructure automation brings agility to both development and operations and reduces the scope for human error. Established software development practices from source control and versioning to automated testing can be applied to infrastructure, laying the foundation for scalability.

# WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?

In many organisations infrastructure departments are still applying non-scalable traditional approaches including manual configuration of environments or writing and running combinations of scripts that must be performed by a team member. Infrastructure should be modelled in scripts or code so it can be versioned, tested and is in line with well- established application software practices. Without consistent, automated configuration management, the release automation of the entire stack becomes very difficult to achieve.

# WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?

* Deployments will become repeatable and reliable with the deployment scripts serving as documentation
* Deployments can be initiated by any team members thereby reducing the reliance on expert members
* Expert engineers are freed up from boring and repetitive deployment tasks and can spend more time on developing software
* Releases are becoming more frequent so valuable feature and updates are reaching the users earlier
* Configuration Management enables the reliable re-creation of every infrastructure element necessary to run an application
