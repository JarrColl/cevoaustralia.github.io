# COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION

Building a DevOps culture is one of the biggest challenges for big and small companies alike. Faster time to market, quicker turnaround based on how fast an organisation can move “single line of code from development to production”.
For too long the IT industry has been working in silos across teams right from product ideation and  product management to product development and product support and maintenance. DevOps is not a tool, methodology, or a set of practices, it is a principle , a mindset. Accepting this new paradigm and being successful at it is a big challenge. Cevo understands this very well and Cevo consultants are the perfect catalyst to make this transition for our customers.

Cevo consultants believe that the best way to lead is [by doing](/cases/devops) and hence our consultants have been working with many organisations to build the underlying technical capabilities. Our experienced consultants provide technical skills , and our business consultants bring people and change management experience help different teams understand and appreciate principles behind DevOps and the value thereof.On one hand Cevo consultants are experienced in tools that nurture devops capability such Jenkins, BuildKite and GoCD, and on the other hand Cevo consultants are also providing guidance and mentoring to customers on the product management , product delivery and change management aspects.


A high performing technology, engineering or software delivery team need to be able to:1.	Form a business case2.	Effectively analyse a problem, understand constraints and form a plan to get it done3.	Design, develop, test and implement a solution4.	Seek feedback and validate the solution met the needs of the business caseAn empowered, poly-skilled, cross-functional team can do all of these tasks in small chunks and short iterations using working software as the primary measure of progress. This is what it is to be agile rather than do agile.




We do this in collaboration with our clients so the engineering skills and experience we bring to your organisation stays within your team long after the project is delivered or the initiative completed.
