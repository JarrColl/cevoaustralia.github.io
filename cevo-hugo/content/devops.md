  "DevOps is about continuously looking for new ways to break down silos, remove bottlenecks, and eliminate inefficiencies â€” all while holding ourselves to a higher standard of software quality and reliability".

# COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION

Devops is a principle, a mindset. It is not a tool, methodology, or a set of practices. Building a devops culture is creating a culture that values speed to market, automation, reliability, quality, customer feedback in the software development lifecycle and automation. We want to realise value quickly and can measure this based on how fast an organisation can move a single line of code from development to production.

A key component of the devops movement is empathy, writing quality code that does not wake someone else up at 3am needing repair. This is why the agile principles are key to the devops movement. 

A high performing technology, engineering or software delivery team need to be able to:1.	Form a business case2.	Effectively analyse a problem, understand constraints and form a plan to get it done3.	Design, develop, test and implement a solution4.	Seek feedback and validate the solution met the needs of the business caseAn empowered, poly-skilled, cross-functional team can do all of these tasks in small chunks and short iterations using working software as the primary measure of progress. This is what it is to be agile (rather than to do agile).

We believe that the best way to lead is [by doing](/cases/devops) so our team have been working with many organisations to build the underlying technical capabilities. Our experienced consultants provide technical skills, and our business consultants bring people and change management experience help different teams understand and appreciate principles behind devops and the value thereof. On one hand Cevo consultants are experienced in tools that nurture devops capability such Jenkins, BuildKite and GoCD, and on the other hand Cevo consultants are also providing guidance and mentoring to customers on the product management , product delivery and change management aspects.







We do this in collaboration with our clients so the devops skills and experience we bring to your organisation stays within your team long after the project is delivered or the initiative completed.

Cevo understands these business challenges and can help you build the engineering capability of your business.

Much of our industry work in silos from product ideation and design, analysis, development, testing, support and maintenance. Accepting this new paradigm is a change management challenge, being successful at it is a big challenge.
