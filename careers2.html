          Our mission is to be Australia’s premier provider of devops, automation and software
          delivery. To do this, we will build a team of great people who solve interesting problems 
          working with awesome clients. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re always looking for smart, motivated team players who want to join our team of like 
          minded people. We’re like‐minded, meaning, yes we like to think that we're good at what 
          we do but more importantly, we respect each others’ opinions and experiences. We’re 
          curious and love to learn but most of all we genuinely can’t wait to get together each 
          month, talk about the month that was and have a good laugh (with some wine and cheese 
          of course).

        <h4>It’s always the little things that make a difference</h4>
        <p>
          Here at Cevo, we know that it takes the sum of us to make a difference to our customers
          through attracting and retaining great people while sharing our learnings to other curious 
          folk. Our goal is to become a destination employer and we think some of the little things we 
          offer can help us get there.
        </p>

        <h4>Sharing is caring</h4>
        <p>
          At Cevo, we know that what we are doing is making a difference and the best people to tell 
          that story is our people. We love to share our stories from some of the awesome projects 
          that we work on and we reward our people for doing just that.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Flexibility is not just for yogi’s</h4>
        <p>
          We hear it all the time, work/life balance, flexibility etc. We encourage you to be yourself 
          and we choose to partner with clients that share those same values as us. Life gets busy and 
          we all handle things differently so being adaptable and flexible is critical to our teams 
          success and peace of mind.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>It’s who you know</h4>
        <p>
          Know someone that would be a great fit for Cevo? We offer our people a nice little incentive 
          to refer more awesome people, it’s paid on start date and at probation end.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Walk the red carpet</h4>
        <p>
          Cevo awards are an important part of our monthly rhythm and an important way to
          recognise our peers for great work. We have various awards that we love to give our 
          people, whether it be a peer, customer or Director recognition, we make sure that the great 
          work you are doing doesn’t go unnoticed.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Let’s work together</h4>
        <p>
          If you think you have what it takes and if you are up for the challenge, working at Cevo can 
          help take your career to the next level. 
          We want to work with people who share our passion for technology and that desire to help 
          deliver the most innovative and leading edge DevOps and cloud automation solutions for 
          our customers. We currently have offices in Melbourne.
