As more and more enterprise scale businesses migrate their workloads across to AWS, the size and complexity of the solutions they are trying to manage are only growing. These businesses will face a set of new challenges, ones that their current organisational structure, staffing skills, processes and practices will not be setup to handle.

Over many months and years, these organisations have created a structure in response to their environment, an environment which was dictated by the inherent constraints and requirements of running your own infrastructure.

Within this environment, the lifecycle for hardware is measured in years as well as needing to manage risks across all aspects of building and running your own systems. These system need to be managed by great teams of people who need to be trained, organised and motivated to keep these systems running 24hrs a day, against an increasing demand from their customers both internal and external.

With the broader acceptance of cloud computing, these larger organisations are now evaluating the suitability for moving across to cloud providers, but one of their biggest challenges will be redesigning their current structure, approach and mindset.

For many organisations when looking at Cloud computing solutions, especially AWS, the initial focus is to:
 * reduce expense and complexity of running a data center,
 * minimise the need to purchase and manage hardware through its lifecycle, and,
 * reduce the staff numbers to install and maintain these systems.

But for savvy organisations, a cloud computing approach can be so much more.  The challenge is to take full advantage of these newly flexible hardware arrangements a move to Cloud computing needs to go so much further, and look not only at the IT systems currently in use, but a full review of the fundamental approach in place to develop and manage these systems.

There are many aspects to cloud computing, and many words have already been written about how to unlock infrastructure for development or application teams to get things done faster or easier.

Often this dream is only that inside these large enterprises, they have invested in specialist teams with specialised skills to ensure they can provide a consistent approach to managing infrastructure that cut across many different departments.  Teams have been formed to manage complex networking requirements, ensure security risks are minimised and often put in broad teams to focus on managing server and storage requirements.

To successfully handle the transition from large scale, on premise infrastructure to a cloud computing approach, the fundamental way these teams and their infrastructure is designed, provisioned, managed and decommissioned needs to be reviewed.

The key constraints of running your own datacenter will be in the area of physical constraints. The amount of storage you have, number of CPU's available and even things like power draw will be key constraints in delivering an infrastructure service.  But in the cloud, you have a much greater agility of infrastructure, and while there still are constraints the primary ones are no longer about managing a fixed fleet of capacity.

So if the primary constraint of limited resources was the environment in which the organisation formed its teams, best practices, processes and culture, it goes to say that when this constraint is reduced, the teams, practices, process and culture all need to be reviewed.

Without reviewing their existing organsational structure, current processes and definitions of best practice, these organisations will not be able to fully capitalise on all of the clouds benefits.

For all organisations at the enterprise scale the size and impact of this review will be challenging for even the most driven CIO. The course change of the magnitude a move to cloud computing can have on IT departments needs to be well managed, to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved.

There have been many examples of adoption of cloud computing, most of which follow a similar approach.

* Create a dedicated team that is focused on adopting a cloud-first approach,
* Empower them to own the entire solution, from concept to execution,
* Focus them on delivering a small number of production grade services,
* Support then when they fail, because they will,
* Ensure that they test their assumptions, and communicate their learnings,
* Provide them sufficient resourcing, training and support,   and
* Ask them to challenge the current processes, assumptions and practices.

If you can successfully create an environment in which the current team structure, processes and approaches can be questioned and challenged in an open, honest and measured approach, you will be half way to identifying the path forward to cloud computing success.

By listening to the feedback from this team, question what they find and assess how you can adopt this feedback into your existing understanding you will then be armed with the information about how to structure your teams, what skills and capabilities do you need to focus on and how your risks will have changed.
