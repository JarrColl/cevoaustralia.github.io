I recently gave a talk at a client titled _DevOps: State Of The Union_. In this talk, I detailed my professional journey driving the DevOps transformation at my former workplace.

The specific items I talked about were:
* **The evolution of the orgnisational structure and culture**
* **Contrasting an IT support operating model at my former workplace to places like Google or Facebook**
* **My perspective on DevOps**
* **Empathy, and why language like 'us' and 'we' is important**
