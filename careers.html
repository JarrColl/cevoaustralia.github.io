          Our mission is to be Australia’s premier provider of devops, automation and software
          delivery. To do this, we will build a team of great people who solve interesting problems
          working with awesome clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re always looking for smart, motivated team players who want to join our team of like
          minded people. We’re like‐minded, meaning, yes we like to think that we're good at what
          we do but more importantly, we respect each others’ opinions and experiences. We’re
          curious and love to learn but most of all we genuinely can’t wait to get together each
          month, talk about the month that was and have a good laugh (with some wine and cheese
          of course).

          Our customers and our people are our lifeline, we live by this and make sure that everyone
          who comes into contact with Cevo remembers how we made them feel.

        <h4>It’s always the little things that make a difference</h4>
        <p>
          Here at Cevo, we know that it takes the sum of us to make a difference to our customers
          through attracting and retaining great people while sharing our learnings to other curious
          folk. Our goal is to become a destination employer and we think some of the little things we
          offer can help us get there.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Sharing is caring</h4>
        <p>
          At Cevo, we know that what we are doing is making a difference and the best people to tell
          that story is our people. We love to share our stories from some of the awesome projects
          that we work on and we reward our people for doing just that.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Flexibility is not just for yogi’s</h4>
        <p>
          We hear it all the time, work/life balance, flexibility etc. We encourage you to be yourself
          and we choose to partner with clients that share those same values as us. Life gets busy and
          we all handle things differently so being adaptable and flexible is critical to our teams
          success and peace of mind.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>It’s who you know</h4>
        <p>
          Know someone that would be a great fit for Cevo? We offer our people a nice little incentive
          to refer more awesome people, it’s paid on start date and at probation end.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Walk the red carpet</h4>
        <p>
          Cevo awards are an important part of our monthly rhythm and an important way to
          recognise our peers for great work. We have various awards that we love to give our
          people, whether it be a peer, customer or Director recognition, we make sure that the great
          work you are doing doesn’t go unnoticed.
        </p>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
        <h4>Let’s work together</h4>
        <p>
          If you think you have what it takes and if you are up for the challenge, working at Cevo can
          help take your career to the next level.
          We want to work with people who share our passion for technology and that desire to help
          deliver the most innovative and leading edge DevOps and cloud automation solutions for
          our customers. We currently have offices in Melbourne.
