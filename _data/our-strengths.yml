    Our goal is to be the best place for great technologists to work. We are doing this by
    building a high calibre team of passionate and talented technologists who are intrinsically
    driven to give back to our community through sharing knowledge and mentoring.
    </p><p>
    We are incubating the next generation of great technology leaders by working with a range
    of clients on solving problems that actually make a difference. To the teams and individuals
    charged with delivering technology outcomes, to the leaders responsible for these
    initiatives, for the end users impacted by our efforts and for our industry as a whole by
    changing the way technology is perceived, utilised and invested in.
    </p><p>
    We are generally born of the open source movement and value trust, respect, honesty,
    openness, excitement, passion and enthusiasm.

    Great minds like hard problems, and the bulk of our work can be categorised as iterative
    software delivery, devops and automation. This involves helping our clients resolve
    challenges around speed, quality, collaboration, communication, work flow, prioritisation,
    technical skills or capability building, tool selection, iterative work practices and
    reengineering organisational process. The nuance is in the approach. What worked for one
    client will not work for another because the constraints are different.
    </p><p>
    There is also a massive difference between giving someone a fish, and teaching them how
    to fish. We make the time to share knowledge in a master/apprentice upskilling model on
    real projects, products and initiatives, leaving a lasting legacy around thinking, problem
    solving approaches, technical skills and internal capability.
    </p><p>
    By frequently challenging our own understanding and perception of the world, we grow
    personally and professionally.

    Our clients are leaders who understand that the most effective approach to solving
    complicated problems is collaboration. Those who recognise that traditional governance,
    structure and process is failing to solve the complicated, rapidly evolving challenges in our
    businesses and organisations.
    </p><p>
    They are leaders who know that the an appropriately poly-skilled, cross functional team that
    have a mandate, executive sponsorship and autonomous decision making capability can
    solve almost any problem. And want to create great working environments around the
    principles of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us">autonomy, mastery and purpose</a> in
    order to get the best out of people, foster engagement, productivity and create great
    working environments.
    </p><p>
    Most importantly, they are the leaders who have made the monumental decision to pursue
    a lean, iterative, experimental approach as the most effective way to tackle and resolve
    complicated problems.
