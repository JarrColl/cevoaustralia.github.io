- text: "Cevo were great. They listened to the goals of our project, what the team needed and they provided great engineers who were exactly what we required. We've been running iterative development for years and needed seasoned agile developers who could blend into the team and immediately contribute in the next sprint. That's who we got. Full-stack experience, and capable from the front end end UI down to automation of AWS infrastructure commissioning. They were a perfect addition to our team and meant we could get the project delivered much more quickly."

Cevo helped us introduce more efficient tagging and reporting capabilities that have unlocked internal back charges, termination of unclaimed resources via an elegant event driven implementation, and the foundations for saving recommendations. Our target is to achieve at least 15% savings through this implementation in this financial year."

- text: "Our developers could have gone through self-training to learn the AWS framework which would have taken a few weeks, however the methodology that David took us through in the 3 days allowed our solution to be deployed to AWS’s infrastructure in time for client testing. During the 3 days with David our team also gained enough knowledge to maintain and further solidify the solution through Continuous Integration ... Without Cevo’s and in particular David’s assistance we would have spent almost 3 weeks getting up to speed with AWS."
