- text: "Cevo engineers did a great job integrating their services into our IT team recently and help us manage our AWS costs more efficiently.  Cevo helped us introduce more efficient tagging and reporting capabilities that have unlocked internal back charges, termination of unclaimed resources via an elegant event driven implementation, and the foundations for saving recommendations. Our target is to achieve at least 15% savings through this implementation in this financial year."

- text: "Our developers could have gone through self-training to learn the AWS framework which would have taken a few weeks, however the methodology that David took us through in the 3 days allowed our solution to be deployed to AWS’s infrastructure in time for client testing. During the 3 days with David our team also gained enough knowledge to maintain and further solidify the solution through Continuous Integration ... Without Cevo’s and in particular David’s assistance we would have spent almost 3 weeks getting up to speed with AWS."
