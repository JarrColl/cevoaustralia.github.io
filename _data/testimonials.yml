- text: "Cevo were engaged to build a set of automated controls that would give both us and APRA the confidence that we were building a cloud environment that met our compliance obligations. The Cevo team came up with an innovative approach to this, making use of native AWS services to implement the controls. The controls are individually testable and can be versioned in source control. They could also easily be deployed consistently across the 40+ AWS accounts that we have with no additional work, meaning that all new workloads that come onto the platform are immediately subject to the same standards"

Cevo helped us introduce more efficient tagging and reporting capabilities that have unlocked internal back charges, termination of unclaimed resources via an elegant event driven implementation, and the foundations for saving recommendations.

During the 3 days with Cevo our team also gained enough knowledge to maintain and further solidify the solution through Continuous Integration ... Without Cevo’s assistance we would have spent almost three weeks getting up to speed with AWS."
