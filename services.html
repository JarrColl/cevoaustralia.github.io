            “The only competitive advantage today is adaptability. To deliver valuable new concepts 
            and solutions faster than the competition, organisations need the ability to rapidly deploy 
            code to production, and then iterate based on customer feedback.”

          <h3>Technology is the business</h3>
          <p>
            Technology evolution has rapidly changed how organisations design, develop and deliver 
            products and services. Digital companies that release software quickly, identify more new 
            market opportunities with less up-front investment. Most importantly, they adapt faster 
            and are better equipped to make more informed decisions on work prioritisation, people and resource allocation.

          <h3>What are the Challenges?</h3>
          <p>
            In large, complex organisations regularly releasing high quality software that customers’ 
            love can be a challenge. Particularly if IT is still on a journey from being a non-critical, back-
            office function to a service-oriented and strategic business enabler.
            Cumbersome organisational workflow, redundant business processes and overzealous 
            governance burden software delivery teams, unnecessarily increasing software delivery 
            cycle time, for no benefit to the end user.
            Annual planning and budgeting can also drive shortsighted and inefficient purchasing 
            decisions. The mindset they create can restrict an organisations ability to respond to shifting 
            market conditions and capitalise quickly on new, unforeseen market opportunities.

        <h2>Devops</h2>
        <div class='spacing'></div>
          <p>
            Devops is about continuously looking for new ways to break down silos, remove bottlenecks, and eliminate inefficiencies — all while holding ourselves to a higher standard of software quality and reliability.
          </p>
          <h3>Communication, collaboration and integration</h3>
          <p>
            Born of the need to improve IT service delivery agility, the devops movement emphasises communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT operations. Rather than seeing these two groups as silos who pass things along, but don’t really work together, devops recognises the interdependence of software development and IT operations and helps an organisation produce software and IT services rapidly, with frequent iterations.

          <h3>What are the Challenges?</h3>
          <p>
            Continuous delivery is an important practice in the devops philosophy, and aims at delivering high quality software in an efficient, fast and reliable manner. Today, in many organisations, the delivery of software is manual, time consuming, stressful and costly. Often, as soon as the application goes live, issues pop up, forcing the organisation into another costly release cycle. Transforming the release process into an automated, reliable, high quality continuous deployment pipeline that is essential to competing in today’s marketplace.

            “A labour intensive approach to IT service delivery is no longer an option and those that 
            persist are already behind. Automating your processes and systems reduces your cycle 
            times and will provide your business with the competitive advantage to stay ahead”.

          <h3>Automate your IT Infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            One of the ultimate objectives of the DevOps discipline is to make IT infrastructure fully 
            programmable and automated – “Infrastructure-as-Code”. Infrastructure Automation is the 
            process of describing your infrastructure and its configuration as a script or set of scripts so 
            that environments can be replicated with minimal human interference. Infrastructure 
            automation brings agility to both development and operations and reduces the scope for 
            human error. Established software development practices from source control and 
            versioning to automated testing can be applied to IT infrastructure, laying the foundation 
            for scalability.
          </p>

      <div class='medium-12 columns'>
          <h3>What are the Challenges?</h3>
          <p>
            In many organisations infrastructure departments are still applying non-scalable “traditional 
            approaches” including manual configuration of environments or writing and running 
            combinations of scripts that must be performed by a team member. But IT infrastructure 
            not modelled in scripts or code cannot be versioned and tested and therefore well-
            established application software practices cannot be applied. Without consistent, 
            automated configuration management, the release automation of the entire stack becomes 
            very difficult to achieve.
