            “The only competitive advantage today is adaptability. To deliver valuable new concepts 
            and solutions faster than the competition, organisations need the ability to rapidly deploy 
            code to production, and then iterate based on customer feedback.”
          </i></p>
          <h3>Technology is the business</h3>
          <p>
            Technology evolution has rapidly changed how organisations design, develop and deliver 
            products and services. Digital companies that release software quickly, identify more new 
            market opportunities with less up-front investment. Most importantly, they adapt faster 
            and are better equipped to make more informed decisions on work prioritisation, people and resource allocation.
          </p>
          <h3>What are the Challenges?</h3>
          <p>
            In large, complex organisations regularly releasing high quality software that customers’ 
            love can be a challenge. Particularly if IT is still on a journey from being a non-critical, back-
            office function to a service-oriented and strategic business enabler.
            Cumbersome organisational workflow, redundant business processes and overzealous 
            governance burden software delivery teams, unnecessarily increasing software delivery 
            cycle time, for no benefit to the end user.
            Annual planning and budgeting can also drive shortsighted and inefficient purchasing 
            decisions. The mindset they create can restrict an organisations ability to respond to shifting 
            market conditions and capitalise quickly on new, unforeseen market opportunities.

          <h3>Why would you be Interested?</h3>
          <p>
            Speed to market. Iterative software development delivers products and services into the 
            hands of customers faster. Save time and money. Reduce the risk of delayed and over 
            budget software projects by delivering iteratively. Do more with less. Save time and effort 
            on low priority development by building the most important components first and using 
            customer validation to identify the point of diminishing return. Improve quality. Reduce 
            software defects and time spent on bug fixing through test automation.
          </p>
          <h3>Consulting</h3>
          <p>
            Our consulting approach is to gain an understanding of your intended outcome, identify the 
            constraints and limitations to achieving it, then collaboratively design a way to get there. 
            This can include short, medium and long-term milestones, tasks that can be completed 
            internally, and aspects you might need some external help with.
            Strategy and Business Process
            To genuinely place the customer to the center of our efforts, most organisations benefit 
            from rethinking system workflow, prioritisation and governance. Engaging stakeholders and 
            reworking entrenched process is a time consuming and difficult process. With your 
            oversight and guidance, Cevo can help drive these initiatives, creating efficiency, 
            engagement and productivity gains across the organisation.
          </p>
          <h3>Co-sourced Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Ambitious programs of work require teams of proficient technologists working effectively 
            together. Cevo’s experienced technologists are happy to roll up sleeves and work with your 
            teams to get software delivered.
          </p>
          <h3>Skills Augmentation</h3>
          <p>
            On occasion you need specialist skills for a period without the time investment or hassle of 
            recruiting. An additional benefit to drafting in a specialist is the knowledge transfer and 
            expertise trade that results from people with different skills and backgrounds working 
            together to achieve a goal.

            “A labour intensive approach to IT service delivery is no longer an option and those that 
            persist are already behind. Automating your processes and systems reduces your cycle 
            times and will provide your business with the competitive advantage to stay ahead”.

          <h3>Automate your IT Infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            One of the ultimate objectives of the DevOps discipline is to make IT infrastructure fully 
            programmable and automated – “Infrastructure-as-Code”. Infrastructure Automation is the 
            process of describing your infrastructure and its configuration as a script or set of scripts so 
            that environments can be replicated with minimal human interference. Infrastructure 
            automation brings agility to both development and operations and reduces the scope for 
            human error. Established software development practices from source control and 
            versioning to automated testing can be applied to IT infrastructure, laying the foundation 
            for scalability.
          </p>
          <h3>What are the Challenges?</h3>
          <p>
            In many organisations infrastructure departments are still applying non-scalable “traditional 
            approaches” including manual configuration of environments or writing and running 
            combinations of scripts that must be performed by a team member. But IT infrastructure 
            not modelled in scripts or code cannot be versioned and tested and therefore well-
            established application software practices cannot be applied. Without consistent, 
            automated configuration management, the release automation of the entire stack becomes 
            very difficult to achieve. 
          </p>

            Deployments will become repeatable and reliable with the deployment scripts serving as 
            documentation.
            Deployments can be initiated by any team members thereby reducing the reliance on expert 
            members.
            Expert engineers are freed up from boring and repetitive deployment tasks and can spend 
            more time on developing software.
            Releases are becoming more frequent so valuable feature and updates are reaching the 
            users earlier.
            Configuration Management enables the reliable re-creation of every infrastructure element 
            necessary to run an application.

            remove bottlenecks, and eliminate inefficiencies — all while holding
            ourselves to a higher standard of quality and reliability. Cevo has
            extensive experience in in helping with the DevOps adoption in large
            organisations. We work with your existing teams and help bridge the
            divide between the development and operations teams as well as providing
